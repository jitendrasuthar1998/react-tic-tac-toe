It is a simple tic-tac-toe game built on react js.

Two players "X" and "O" can play this game.

Whenever a user selects any box, that time a sound will be played.

If there is the same user icon in any row, column, or diagonal, that time that user will be won.
and the game will be over. and you will also hear a winning sound.

If there is no same user in three boxes of any row, column, or diagonal, that game will be called a draw.

If there is any winner or draw, that time reset button will be displayed.

Users can click on the reset button and start a new game.
